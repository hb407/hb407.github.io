           Quantum chemistry is usually considered with mathematically real energies. 
           This leads to the idea that electrons in a molecule
           can only take particular &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; energy levels.
           We explore the surprising consequences of allowing the energy to be complex-valued, 
           and find that discrete energy levels become unified as one continuous 
           mathematical structure.

       Electronic energy levels in molecules are conventionally considered as real-valued and discrete, giving 
       &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;excited&rdquo; states. However, if we mathematically extend our equations
       to complex numbers &mdash; known as <i>analytic continuation</i> &mdash; we find that ground and excited states become
       unified as one continuous energy surface: a <i>Riemann surface</i>.
       In fact, discrete energy levels only arise by restricting our perspective to real numbers.
       These remarkable continuous energy surfaces allow a ground-state wave function to be continuously evolved
       into an excited-state wave function by following a well-defined pathway in the complex-plane.
       We have discovered the first examples of such pathways within electronic structure theory and we investigating
       how they can be used to locate state-specific representations of excited states.

       We are also interested in the fundamental properties of non-Hermitian extensions to electronic structure
       methods and how this affects their behaviour on the real axis.
       For example, the convergence of perturbation theory is controlled by the location of non-Hermitian degeneracies
       in the complex plane. 
       Furthermore, we have discovered that combined parity-time symmetry in electronic structure
       can enforce real-valued energies, even for complex non-Hermitian wave functions.
       We believe that understanding these fundamental properties will allow entirely new electronic structure
       approximations to be developed.

           We are developing a new way to interpret molecular electronic energy levels 
           as stationary points of an energy landscape, rather like a mountain range. The lowest-energy
           level corresponds to the valley bottom, while higher-energy levels are represented
           as high mountain passes and summit peaks. We can then explore and understand the fascinating pathways
           that connect different stationary points.

       Our current dependence on the molecular orbital and Slater determinant view of chemistry obscures our perspective on exact wave functions. For example, an exact wave function that is poorly represented by a single reference determinant is described as a “multiconfigurational” wave function, implying that it forms as a linear combination of many states. Instead, we can view the approximate wave function as a linear expansion of exact states, emphasising the idea of ‘spin’ and ‘energetic’ contaminants in the approximate solution.
       In this Research Theme, we will revisit exact wave functions as stationary points of an energy landscape problem to gain a new perspective on electronic structure theory. Some areas of electronic structure theory have already been considered as energy landscapes for a long time. For example, the breakdown of SCF theory in the presence of strong correlation is often viewed as a stability problem,25 where the symmetry-pure ground-state becomes a higher-index saddle.26 We will extend these ideas to look at the relationship between approximate solutions and exact stationary points. This approach will provide new insights into the failure of approximate methods without relying on traditional concepts such as multi-determinant expansions or excitation amplitudes.

       The ground-state of a molecule near its equilibrium structure can often be predicted with a single mean-field approximation to the electronic structure such as Hartree–Fock theory. How- ever, this mean-field approximation fails catastrophically in the presence of competing electronic configurations, for instance representing the reactant and product at a transition state. The con- ventional solution would be to use a multiconfigurational approach such as Complete Active Space Self-Consistent-Field (CASSCF), although these methods are limited by their severe computational demand. Alternatively we have found that, when many electronic configurations arise, one can find multiple solutions to the mean-field approximation that each represent a dominant configuration.1,2 In this presentation, I will outline where and why these multiple mean-field solutions emerge, and what chemical information they can provide.3 I will then demonstrate how taking a linear combina- tion of multiple mean-field states in a Nonorthogonal Configuration Interaction (NOCI) expansion can provide an efficiently alternative for computing potential energy surfaces across all molecular structures.3–6 Since our method exploits only mean-field approximations to the electronic structure, it can provide qualitatively correct energy surfaces while retaining computational efficiency. Fi- nally, I will illustrate the performance of this new approach using pedagogical chemical systems and discuss its prospects for future development and application.
