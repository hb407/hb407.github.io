    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am the Astor Junior Research Fellow in Chemistry at <a href="https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/hugh-burton">New College, Oxford</a>
    and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford.
    My primary research involves understanding the breakdown of electronic structure approximations in the 
    presence of <i>strongly coupled electrons</i> and developing new theoretical methods to accurately predict the properties
    of electrons in molecules.  
    In particular, I am interested in the failure of <i>independent particle models</i> in the presence of 
    strong correlation, and the existence of multiple solutions to the self-consistent field equations.
    My other projects include exploiting <i>nonorthogonal many-electron basis states</i> for describing strong 
    correlation in molecules, and constructing  <i>non-Hermitian analytic continuations</i> that allow an electronic ground state
    to be smoothly morphed into an excited state.
    </p>

    <p>I was previously a postdoctoral research associate with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/dw34">Prof. David Wales</a> 
    at the University of Cambridge, U.K. 
    During this time, I developed the <i>electronic structure energy landscape</i> framework where approximate electronic states exist
    as stationary points of the corresponding electronic energy surface. 
    This approach allows the properties and connectivity of multiple electronic stationary points to be systematically
    investigated, providing guiding principles for the development of <i>state-specific excited-state</i> methods.
    </p>
    
    <p>I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ajwt3">Dr Alex Thom</a> at the 
    University of Cambridge in 2020. During this period, I pioneered the <i>holomorphic Hartree-Fock</i> approach for 
    generating continuous Hartree-Fock solutions as a basis for multireference calculations. In holomorphic Hartree-Fock theory, 
    conventional Hartree-Fock solutions are analytically continued into the complex plane beyond the molecular structures at which 
    they vanish. My <a href="https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.55079">thesis</a> showed that construcing a linear combination of 
    these solutions allows qualitatively accurate electronic 
    energies to be predicted for bond-breaking processes and molecular binding curves.
    </p>

    <p>In the summer of 2018, I undertook a two-month research internship at <a href="https://www.q-chem.com">Q-Chem Inc.</a>, 
    an electronic structure software package based in Pleasanton CA, USA. At Q-Chem, I developed a new dedicated library for 
    running <i>nonorthogonal configuration interaction</i> calcuations on molecules. This library is now available in 
    latest public release of the Q-Chem software package.
    </p>

    <p>Prior to my PhD, I studied chemistry at the University of Cambridge. As part of my studies, I completed a research project
    with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/df246">Prof. Daan Frenkel</a>, investigating the <i>thermophoretic flow</i> of 
    atoms under the influence of temperature graidents at liquid-liquid interfaces.
