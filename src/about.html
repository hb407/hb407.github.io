    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am the Astor Junior Research Fellow in Chemistry at <a href="https://www.new.ox.ac.uk/hugh-burton">New College, Oxford</a>
    and a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.chem.ox.ac.uk">Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford</a>.
    My primary research involves understanding the breakdown of electronic structure approximations in the 
    presence of <i><b>strongly coupled electrons</b></i> and developing new theoretical methods to accurately predict the properties
    of electrons in molecules.  
    I am particularly interested in the failure of <i><b>independent particle models</b></i> in the presence of 
    strong correlation, and the existence of multiple solutions in electronic structure approximations.
    My other projects include exploiting <i><b>nonorthogonal many-electron basis states</b></i> to predict molecular potential
    energy surfaces, and investigating how <i><b>non-Hermitian analytic continuations</b></i> can help us understand
    quantum chemistry.
    </p>

    <p>In the summer of 2020, I was a postdoctoral research associate with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/dw34">Prof. David Wales</a> 
    at the University of Cambridge, U.K. 
    I developed the <i><b>electronic structure energy landscape</b></i> framework where electronic ground and excited states exist
    as stationary points of a high-dimensional energy surface.
    This approach allows the properties and connectivity of multiple electronic states to be systematically
    investigated, providing guiding principles for the development of high accuracy <i><b>excited-state methods</b></i>.
    </p>
    
    <p>I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ajwt3">Dr Alex Thom</a> at the 
    University of Cambridge in 2020. During this period, I pioneered the <i><b>holomorphic Hartree-Fock</b></i> approach that
    allows complex analytic continuations of multiple Hartree&ndash;Fock solutions to be constructed across all structures of a
    molecule.
    My <a href="https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.55079">thesis</a> showed that a linear combination of these complex-valued
    solutions can provide numerically accurate to be predicted for bond-breaking processes and molecular binding curves.
    </p>

    <p>In the summer of 2018, I undertook a two-month research internship at <a href="https://www.q-chem.com">Q-Chem Inc.</a>, 
    an electronic structure software company based in Pleasanton CA, USA. At Q-Chem, I developed a new dedicated library for 
    running <i><b>nonorthogonal configuration interaction</b></i> calcuations on molecules. This library is now available in 
    latest public release of the Q-Chem software package.
    </p>

    <p>Prior to my PhD, I studied chemistry at the University of Cambridge. As part of my studies, I completed a research project
    with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/df246">Prof. Daan Frenkel</a>, investigating the <i><b>thermophoretic flow</b></i> of 
    atoms under the influence of temperature graidents at liquid-liquid interfaces.
