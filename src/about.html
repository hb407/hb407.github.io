    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a postdoctoral research associate working with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/dw34">Prof. David Wales</a> 
    at the University of Cambridge, U.K. My primary research involves investigating the properties 
    of <i>electronic structure energy landscapes</i>. In particular, I am interested
    in understanding the topology of multiple solutions to the self-consistent field equations.  
    My other projects include exploiting <i>nonorthogonal many-electron basis states</i> for describing strong 
    correlation in molecules, and constructing  <i>non-Hermitian analytic continuations</i> that allow an electronic ground state
    to be smoothly morphed into an excited state.
    </p>

    <p>I completed my PhD under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/ajwt3">Dr Alex Thom</a> at the 
    University of Cambridge in 2020. During this period, I pioneered the <i>holomorphic Hartree-Fock</i> approach for 
    generating continuous Hartree-Fock solutions as a basis for multireference calculations. In holomorphic Hartree-Fock theory, 
    conventional Hartree-Fock solutions are analytically continued into the complex plane beyond the molecular structures at which 
    they vanish. My thesis showed that construcing a linear combination of these solutions allows qualitatively accurate electronic 
    energies to be predicted for bond-breaking processes and molecular binding curves.

    <p>In the summer of 2018, I undertook a two-month research internship at <a href="https://www.q-chem.com">Q-Chem Inc.</a>, 
    an electronic structure software package based in Pleasanton CA, USA. At Q-Chem, I developed a new dedicated library for 
    running <i>nonorthogonal configuration interaction</i> calcuations on molecules. This library is now available in 
    latest public release of the Q-Chem software package.
    </p>

    <p>Prior to my PhD, I studied chemistry at the University of Cambridge. As part of my studies, I completed a research project
    with <a href="https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk/person/df246">Prof. Daan Frenkel</a>, investigating the <i>thermophoretic flow</i> of 
    atoms under the influence of temperature graidents at liquid-liquid interfaces.
