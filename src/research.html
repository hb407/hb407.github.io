       Quantum chemistry is usually considered with mathematically real energies. 
       This leads to the idea that electrons in a molecule
       can only take particular &ldquo;discrete&rdquo; energy levels.
       We explore the surprising consequences of allowing the energy to be complex-valued, 
       and find that discrete energy levels become unified as one continuous 
       mathematical structure.

    Electronic energy levels in molecules are conventionally considered as real-valued and discrete, giving 
    &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;excited&rdquo; states. However, if we mathematically extend our equations
    to complex numbers &mdash; known as <i>analytic continuation</i> &mdash; we find that ground and excited states become
    unified as one continuous energy surface: a <i>Riemann surface</i>.
    In fact, discrete energy levels only arise by restricting our perspective to real numbers.
    These remarkable continuous energy surfaces allow a ground-state wave function to be continuously evolved
    into an excited-state wave function by following a well-defined pathway in the complex-plane.
    We have discovered the first examples of such pathways within electronic structure theory and we investigating
    how they can be used to locate state-specific representations of excited states.

    We are also interested in the fundamental properties of non-Hermitian extensions to electronic structure
    methods and how this affects their behaviour on the real axis.
    For example, the convergence of perturbation theory is controlled by the location of non-Hermitian degeneracies
    in the complex plane. 
    Furthermore, we have discovered that combined parity-time symmetry in electronic structure
    can enforce real-valued energies, even for complex non-Hermitian wave functions.
    We believe that understanding these fundamental properties will allow entirely new electronic structure
    approximations to be developed.

           We are developing a new way to interpret molecular electronic energy levels 
           as stationary points of an energy landscape, rather like a mountain range. The lowest-energy
           level corresponds to the valley bottom, while higher-energy levels are represented
           as high mountain passes and summit peaks. We can investigate the fascinating pathways
           that connect different stationary points.

    Excited electronic states in molecules have traditionally been predicted by considering the response of an approximate
    ground state to an external field, or by solving large matrix eigenvalue problems.
    These approaches are typically biased towards the ground-state properties, limiting the accuracy of 
    the corresponding excited-state models. We are exploring an entirely new perspective whereby excited-state 
    approximations exist as higher-energy stationary points of a high-dimensional electronic energy surface.
    These higher-energy stationary points correspond to individually optimised &ldquo;state-specific&rdquo; wave functions 
    and can provide a more accurate representation of excited-state properties.
    By understanding the structure of this high-dimensional energy surface for different
    electronic structure approximations, we hope to develop new automated algorithms to locate
    state-specific representations of excited states.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Our energy landscape perspective can also help us understand where and why simple electronic structure
    models break down. For example, the failure of the mean-field Hartree&ndash;Fock approximation in the presence
    of strong electron coupling corresponds to the formation of symmetry-broken local minima on the energy surface.
    Directly comparing the simplistic model energy surface to the exact landscape can allow us to understand
    this failure and identify novel ways to improve our computational models.

       The ground-state of a molecule near its equilibrium structure can often be predicted with a single mean-field approximation to the electronic structure such as Hartree–Fock theory. How- ever, this mean-field approximation fails catastrophically in the presence of competing electronic configurations, for instance representing the reactant and product at a transition state. The con- ventional solution would be to use a multiconfigurational approach such as Complete Active Space Self-Consistent-Field (CASSCF), although these methods are limited by their severe computational demand. Alternatively we have found that, when many electronic configurations arise, one can find multiple solutions to the mean-field approximation that each represent a dominant configuration.1,2 In this presentation, I will outline where and why these multiple mean-field solutions emerge, and what chemical information they can provide.3 I will then demonstrate how taking a linear combina- tion of multiple mean-field states in a Nonorthogonal Configuration Interaction (NOCI) expansion can provide an efficiently alternative for computing potential energy surfaces across all molecular structures.3–6 Since our method exploits only mean-field approximations to the electronic structure, it can provide qualitatively correct energy surfaces while retaining computational efficiency. Fi- nally, I will illustrate the performance of this new approach using pedagogical chemical systems and discuss its prospects for future development and application.
